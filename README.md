python-challenge
The task is to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

I created a new repository for this project called python-challenge and cloned the new repository to my computer.

Inside my local Git repository I created a folder for each Python assignment and named them PyBank and PyPoll.

In each folder I then added the following content:

A new file called main.py. This is the main script to run for each analysis.

A Resources folder that contains the CSV files.

An analysis folder that contains my text file that has the results from the analysis.

PYBANK CHALLENGE: I was to utilise a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

I created a Python script to analyse the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My analysis should show the following results:

Financial Analysis
Total Months: 86 Total: 
-8311.11 Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 (
-1825558) In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PYPOLL CHALLENGE: In this Challenge my task was to help a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process.

I was to utilise a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task is to create a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

My analysis should show the following results:

Election Results
Total Votes: 369711
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213) Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892) Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
Winner: Diana DeGette
In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
